Wearable Health Monitor App with Kivy and PyBluez

As a part of my Final Year project, I created a UI
for the Wearable Health Monitor Device to stream
the sensor values.

The app is built using Kivy and MySQL Database.
The app also uses PyBluez module to communicate
with the ESP-32 (Built-in Bluetooth).
The Wearable device has three sensors: MAX30101 photoplethesmography sensor,
MPU-6050 IMU unit and TMP117 temperature sensor.
The app has multiple pages and comes with the database 
download feature as well.

Please explore the code and hopefully you'll find it useful.
Thanks.
